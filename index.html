                        <h3>What is Sportance?</h3>
                            <p>Sportance was founded in 2017 with the aim to help athletes, teams, coaches and support staff with Sport Psychology interventions and techniques. Understanding and using these techniques allow sports performers and support staff to be the best they can be. Often athletes and coaches only focus on the physical training to help them improve and therefore, neglect the mental side of training. Sportance’s aim is to educate, support and implement interventions to help sports professionals across the board. We want sports professionals to be the best they can be by unlocking the power of their brain. </p>

                        <p>Working with the team at Sportance has been fantastic. Right from the outside I felt comfortable with the friendly professional they have there. After an initial consultation, we worked through a programme to help me with my confidence leading up to a game. For a few years I have struggled with this and it has become more of an a problem for me as the games and competitors have been getting tougher. Therefore I decided to seek some professional help and got in touch with the guys at Sportance. After agreeing an intervention programme, which involved routine and positive self talk, my confidence levels before a game have begun to increase and so have my performances. I still have a lot of work to do but so far it’s been great. I can’t wait to continue working hard with the guys at Sportance.</p>

                        <p>Performing to my usual high standards under pressure had been a big struggle for my until I got in contact with the Tim at Sportance. After my initial meeting we identified some areas to work on which would help me perform better under pressurised situations. Tim and I worked through some imagery and visualisation techniques over the course of 8 weeks. Each time imaging that I was put under pressure and dealing with it well to achieve a positive outcome. The results have been great and I have scored my highest break ever and won my first regional tournament. I have loved every session and sport psychology is something I will continue to use through my sporting career. </p>
