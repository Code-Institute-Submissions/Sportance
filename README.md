# Sportance - Milestone Project 1

## Introduction

A website designed to bring Sports Psychology to life. Many people are still unaware that Sport Psychology exists and therefore have a lot of questions when they find out. Therefore, Sportance is design to give every user the information that they need by answering the most common questions that get asked. It is a staic website that will give the users enough information to decide whether Sport Psychology is a thing for them or not. It is a safe space that users can easily navigate their way around in order to give them relevant and up to date information.
