## Features

### Existing Features

The features that were added to the project were designed to have a high level of usability.

* The logo is wrapped in an anchor tag with the link to the Sportance page. This allows it to be used as a refresh for the page should the user need to.
* The menu bar at the top will allow the users to easily navigate around the webpage should they chose not to scroll through the whole page to find the section they are looking for. 
* A menu icon is used in phone view so that is does not overcrowd the header and hero image.
* A hero image was added to make the webpage inviting to the user and make the website self explanatory.
* An About section was used to give the user all the information they need about the webpage and its purpose. A sports image was added to this section to keep in with the design of the rest of the webpage and make it more pleasing to view for the users.
* A services section was used to allow the users to decide whether the services suit their needs and that could be of use to them. This section also allows other Sport Psychology professionals to view what they could potentially add to their services. Images of the types of services were added to tie in with the rest of the webpage.
* A testimonials section was used to allow the users to see the previous work carried out by the Sport Psychology and again decide if they want to access the help on offer. Image of the athletes who have given a testimonial were added so the user could picture who was saying them.
* A contact section was used to allow users to get in touch should they have any questions about the services or Sport Psychogy in general.
* Within the footer are links to each section should the user wish to quickly navigate their way back to a certain section. There is also links to the social media pages that Sportance uses. 


### Features Left to Implement

* A video library where users can access mediation materials that they can use at home. 
* A useful links section that allows users to directly access useful information about Sport Psychology sourced on other websites.

## Testing
---
* The user stories achieved their intended outcome and allowed the users to find out information about Sportance and what it offers. The About section allows users to learn more about Sport Psychology and how it could benefit them in their sports performance. Based on the information in the About section and the services section the users can decide if they feel that they have a need for the services offered by the team at Sportance. If the users are still unsure about Sport Psychology and whether they feel it will benefit them, they can read the two testimonials provided to give them confidence that Sport Psychology does work. This will hopefully encourage the user to get in touch and ask more questions. The User can do this by filling in the contact form.  The user is also able to access Sportance’s social media accounts by clicking on the links in the footer of the page.

* The navbar at the top of the page allows the user to navigate their way quickly around the page. Each nav link takes the user to their desired section when clicked. The navbar is responsive and a navbar toggler appears when the screen size is below 768px. This means that the navbar does not become congested and allow a more user-friendly navigation. The Sportance logo in the navbar is a link to home which will when clicked will return the user to the top of the page instead of them scrolling. The navbar is fixed to the top of the page to allow the user to navigate easily when scrolling through the page. 

* The hero image allows the user to get a sense of what the webpage is all about and this is responsive across all viewports. This is further enhanced by the use of a Jumbotron which sits on top of the hero image. The tagline is intended to encourage the users to continue reading down the webpage. The Jumbotron text disappears on screen sizes below 992px so that it does not crowd the screen. 

* All sections are responsive and have been tested on all viewport widths using chrome developer tools to ensure they style correctly. 

* The user is required to fill in all the fields of the contact form before they can submit. If they do not fill in all fields, they will be prompted by a reminder to do so.

* The footer consists of links to all sections on the webpage and Sportance’s social media accounts. All links work correctly and take the user to the desired location. All social media links open a new window using ‘target=”blank”’. The social media links disappear when the screen size is below 992px. Also ‘rel=”noopener”’ was added to each social media link to ensure the new page is not able to access the window.opener process. 

* Aria labels have been added to all anchor tags and inputs to ensure there is accessibility for all users.
