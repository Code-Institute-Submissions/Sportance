* A services section was used to allow the users to decide whether the services suit their needs and that could be of use to them. This section also allows other Sport Psychology professionals to view what they could potentially add to their services. Images of the types of services were added to tie in with the rest of the webpage.
* A testimonials section was used to allow the users to see the previous work carried out by the Sport Psychology and again decide if they want to access the help on offer. Image of the athletes who have given a testimonial were added so the user could picture who was saying them.
